# SPURProject4
## 1st Week: 
### Initialize the problem: 
#### Solve the Initial Value Problem. 
- Find the solution for the IVP Problem (get two output) 
- Put all the solutions into Solve_IVP_Particles.m (maybe for the BVP Problem)
- Fixed the plot_function.m into plot_function_new.m which plot two particles and the solution for the IVP solution

## Second Week:
### Tuesday:
#### Solve IVP for n particles
- Modified diff_eqns, now it solves n particles at the same time
- It is missing a plot function for the n particles
##### - Hy - Solve IVP for n particles
- Solved n particles with length (doesn't depend on the output of previous particles) 
- Fixed Plot Function for this problem.
#### Include forces function 
- Calculate forces at every particle for a given configuration
- Calculates potential at every particle for a given configuration (not used for the forces)
